### How use it

is very important know that to use this service you need to pass to the server path the endpoint `/resize` with the method `POST` and in the request body pass the next values as json format:

```json
{
  "name": "check",
  "size_x": 250,
  "size_y": 180,
  "type_format": ".webp",
  "base64": "your code"
}
```
- remember pass the format with the preffix dot `.` 
- the base64's code usually has this format (data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgA...) but for this service, you need to pass just the code after the `,`, don't pass this part (data:image/png;base64,)
